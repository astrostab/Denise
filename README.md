# Denise
Fast and simple web browser based on javafx and WebKit.


A project I started working about end of 2020, just to see if simple web browser can be build reasonably fast using available open source libraries and technologies. 
It turned out, there is already WebEngine and WebView classes available in JavaFX system that can be used for that purpose. These libraries are based on webkit - which is a web browser engine (https://webkit.org/)

Denise is built on java and javafx.

It is really simple web browser. It contains only most necessary features to make it simple and fast. Everything is available on main window with some extra information output to command line. No options, menus etc...

One thing that is unique to Denise versus other browsers ( as of Aug 2022) is automatic page refresh. This just reloads (refreshes) the page in user defined time intervals - useful if you want to monitor a page for for a price change or something like that...
