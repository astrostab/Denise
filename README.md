Fast and simple web browser based on javafx and WebKit.


A project I started working on about 2 years ago (end of 2020), just to see if simple web browser can be build reasonably fast using available open source libraries and technologies. 
It turned out, there is already WebEngine and WebView classes available in JavaFX system that can be used for this purpose. Those in turn are build on webkit - which is a web browser engine (https://webkit.org/)

Denise is built on java and javafx.

It is really simple web browser. It contains only most necessary features to make it simple and fast. Everything is available on main window with some extra information output to command line. No options, menus etc...

Few things in it actually don't do anything - like charts - which I put in, to see how charts work in javafx in first place.

One thing I'm pretty sure is unique to Denise versus all other web browsers( as of Aug 2022) is automatic page refresh feature. This just reloads (refreshes) the page in user defined time frequency - useful if you want to monitor a page for for example price change or something like that...
